<h1 id="m2">Using M2</h1>

<h2 id="m2-introduction">Introduction to M2</h2>

<p>
M2 is Opera's news and e-mail client, designed for speed, elegance, and user friendliness.
It has many unique features:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>M2 is immensely responsive even with thousands of messages</li>
	<li>Use the &quot;Quick reply&quot; field for fast and chat-like e-mail messaging</li>
	<li>Folders (access points) to mailing lists and attachments are generated automatically</li>
	<li>E-mail searches update dynamically when you get new messages</li>
	<li>Click on a contact to see all messages from that contact</li>
	<li>IMAP and news are integrated</li>
</ul>

<p>
With M2, creating folders and sorting messages manually becomes superfluous.
To see a group of messages instantly, for example all messages from a certain person or all messages with image attachments, simply click the corresponding access point.
</p>

<p>
All messages in M2 are kept in a database and can therefore appear several places.
If a friend has posted a message on a mailing list, the message will appear both under your mailing-list access point and the access point for your friend.
</p>

<p>
The Received folder contains all your incoming messages.
You do not have to move any messages from this folder.
Instead, you can make a message appear in as many additional folders as you like.
</p>

<p>
If you delete an access point, the messages it referred to are not deleted because an access point only contains pointers to messages.
You can only delete messages in the list of messages (message view).
</p>

<p>
To save disk space, M2 will automatically compress mail boxes if needed.
</p>

<h2 id="m2-import">Importing e-mail</h2>

<p>
Follow this procedure to import messages, contact information, and settings:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Select <span class="mainmenu">New account</span> on the <span class="mainmenu"><a href="main.html#mailmenu">Mail</a></span> menu</li>
	<li>Select &quot;Import e-mail&quot;</li>
	<li>Select which e-mail client to import from</li>
	<li>Click <input type="button" class="button" value="Choose"/> to select folder to import from, unless already correct</li>
	<li>Select which old account to import from</li>
	<li>Select whether to import settings, contact, messages, or a combination</li>
	<li>Click <input type="button" class="button" value="Next"/> to start importing</li>
	<li>When the import process is done, click <input type="button" class="button" value="Finish"/></li>
</ol>

<p>
Messages are imported like this:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Your old folder tree is put under &quot;My folders&quot; in the Hotlist</li>
	<li>Messages in your old Outbox, Sent, Drafts, and Trash folders are put in the corresponding M2 folders</li>
	<li>All old incoming messages (Inbox and folder tree) will appear in M2's Received folder</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="m2-new">New account</h2>

<p>
Follow this procedure to set up a new account without importing old messages:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Select <span class="mainmenu">New account</span> on the <span class="mainmenu"><a href="main.html#mailmenu">Mail</a></span> menu</li>
	<li>Select type of e-mail account (POP if you are unsure)</li>
	<li>Enter your name, e-mail address, and optionally an organization you belong to</li>
	<li>Enter your user (log-in) name and password (given to you bey your service provider)</li>
	<li>Enter mail-server information from your service provider</li>
	<li>Click <input type="button" class="button" value="Finish"/> to create the account</li>
</ol>

<p>
After your account has been set up, M2 will transfer, from the mail server, messages that are not already on your computer.
This may take some time, but you can use M2 and Opera in the meantime.
</p>

<p>
<span class="note">Tip:</span>
See Opera's on-line article for information about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.opera.com/support/search/supsearch.dml?index=596">using M2 with your Premium OperaMail account</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="m2-compose">Writing messages</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Start
			<ol class="alfa">
				<li>Click Compose or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd> to compose a new message</li>
				<li>Double-click a message in the Drafts folder to continue editing a draft</li>
				<li>Double-click a message in the Sent folder to resend an old message, with changes if you like</li>
			</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Enter recipients' e-mail addresses in the To, Cc, and Bcc fields (auto-completion will be offered for Contacts)</li>
	<li>Enter your message's subject</li>
	<li>Write your message</li>
	<li>If you wish to add files to the message, click Attach</li>
	<li>Finish
			<ol class="alfa">
				<li>Save the message as a draft by pressing Save if you wish to continue later</li>
				<li>Send the message by pressing Send in the Compose view</li>
			</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
<span class="note">Tip:</span>
To change the plain-text font in the compose window, go to <a href="fonts.html">Fonts and colors</a> in Preferences and choose a new font for multi-line text fields in forms.
</p>

<p>
<span class="note">Tip:</span>
Click the View menu to show or hide elements in the Compose view.
</p>

<h2 id="m2-read">Reading messages</h2>

<p>
M2 transfers new messages to your computer on a regular basis, so you do not have to check your messages manually.
</p>

<p>
To go through your new messages, enable the Hotlist with <kbd>F4</kbd>, click the Mail tab, and double-click Unread to see all unread messages.
</p>

<h3>Message view explained</h3>

<p>
The message view is divided into four parts:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Toolbar with buttons for common actions</li>
	<li>Field that lists (unread) messages</li>
	<li>Field that displays the contents of the currently selected message</li>
	<li>Field used to &quot;quick reply&quot; to a message</li>
</ol>

<p>You can click on the columns to sort listed messages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The left-most column displays a symbol for each message:
<table class="nice">
	<tr>
		<th>Symbol</th>
		<th>Meaning</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Star</td>
		<td>New messages are marked as unread</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Checkmark</td>
		<td>You have marked the message as read</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Arrow pointing up</td>
		<td>The message has been sent (outgoing messages)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Arrow pointing left</td>
		<td>You have replied to the message</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Arrow pointing right</td>
		<td>You have forwarded the message</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Twisted triangle</td>
		<td>You have redirected the message</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</li>

<li>The Subject column displays a triangle if the message belongs to a thread (click to expand), and an envelope to indicate that the message is an e-mail</li>
<li>The paper-clip column displays an icon for messages that contain file attachments</li>
</ul>

<p>
Messages in <span class="red">red</span> have not been seen yet (selected by cursor).
Messages in <span class="bold">bold</span> have not been marked as read yet.
</p>

<h3>Reading messages</h3>

<p>
Below is a suggested procedure for going through your incoming (unread) messages:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Recognize it!
			<ol class="alfa">
				<li>If a message is spam (advertising, propaganda, etc.) press <kbd>Delete</kbd> to put it in your Trash folder</li>
				<li>If a message is from a friend, and the icon in the From column is ghosted, press <kbd>A</kbd> to add your friend to your Contacts</li>
			</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Handle it!
			<ol class="alfa">
				<li>To reply instantly to a message, enter your reply in the field to the left of the &quot;Quick reply&quot; button and click the button</li>
				<li>If you wish to edit a message before replying, press <kbd>R</kbd></li>
				<li>To forward a message to a third party, press <kbd>F</kbd></li>
				<li>If you wish to handle a message later, click Label to set a label (e.g. Important or Meeting); the message will appear under the Labels access point</li>
			</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Move on!
			<ol class="alfa">
				<li>When you have handled a message, press <kbd>G</kbd> to mark it as read and move to the next unread message</li>
			</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
When you have gone through your unread messages, go to the Hotlist, open your mailing lists, and repeat the procedure.
</p>

<p>
Once in a while, take the trouble to check your Spam folder.
If a message from a friend has been mistakenly marked as spam, click the &quot;Not spam&quot; button to make it appear as an ordinary message in your Unread folder.
</p>

<h3>Message-view features</h3>

<p>
Here are some things you can do in the message view:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sort the message list by clicking the column headers (From, Subject, etc.)</li>
	<li>Find particular messages by entering text in the &quot;Quick find&quot; field (which searches message headers like To, From, and Subject)</li>
	<li>Click &quot;Display all headers&quot; to view the e-mail headers (more information) of a selected message</li>
</ul>

<p>
Right-click a message for multiple choices:
</p>

</p>

<p>
<span class="note">Advanced tip:</span>
You can specify quote levels to strip in &quot;accounts.ini&quot;.
The replacement text can be edited in &quot;english.lng&quot;.

</p>

<h3>Building your own folder tree</h3>

<p>
If you wish to organize your messages beyond what M2 does automatically, you can create traditional message folders with filters.
</p>

<p>
To create a top-level folder, right-click &quot;My folders&quot; and select <span class="mainmenu">New folder</span>.
You can build a folder tree by creating folders within folders.
</p>

<p>
You can make messages appear in your folders:
</p>

<ol class="alfa">
	<li>Manually, by right-clicking a message in the message view, and selecting a folder under &quot;Copy to&quot;</li>
	<li>Automatically, by creating message filters</li>
</ol>

<p>
<span class="note">Tip:</span>
You can make a message appear in as many folders as you like.
</p>

<h2 id="m2-filter">Message filters</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Select <span class="mainmenu">Filters</span> on the <span class="mainmenu"><a href="main.html#mailmenu">Mail</a></span> menu</li>
	<li>Select folder for which to make a filter
		<ul><li>Spam folder and folders under &quot;My folders&quot; only</li></ul>
	</li>
	<li>Click <input type="button" class="button" value="Add filter"/> to create a new filter</li>
	<li>Select which part of the message to scan</li>
	<li>Select how to evaluate the text</li>
	<li>Enter text to look for</li>
	<li>Select whether to mark a message as read if it matches the filter</li>
	<li>Select whether to let the filter apply to all messages, or only messages you receive from now on</li>
	<li>Repeat the procedure if you need multiple filter rules
		<ul><li>When using And and Or, And is processed before Or</li></ul>
	</li>
	<li>Activate the filter by clicking <input type="button" class="button" value="OK"/></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="m2-spam">Spam filter</h2>

<p>
The Spam folder separates advertisement and unwanted messages from messages in other folders.
Spam can be handled in two ways:
</p>

<ol class="alfa">
	<li>Manually, by creating a message filter for the Spam folder</li>
	<li>Automatically, using the built-in M2 spam filter</li>
</ol>

<p>
As an experiment, try to make a message filter for the Spam folder that looks for the phrase &quot;SPAM LETTER&quot;.
Then send a message to yourself containing this text and see if the spam filter catches it.
</p>

<p>
The internal spam filter examines messages for suspicious content, missing sender address, etc.
If too many questionable matters are found, the message is considered spam.
You can set the internal filter to be agressive, mild, or turn it off completely if you want to handle spam manually.
</p>

<h2 id="m2-search">Finding messages</h2>

<p>
As the number of messages on your computer grows, it becomes necessary to quickly find just that one particular message you are looking for:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Select <span class="mainmenu">Search</span> on the <span class="mainmenu"><a href="main.html#mailmenu">Mail</a></span> menu</li>
	<li>In the dialog that opens, enter the text to look for</li>
	<li>Select which parts of a message you want to search
		<ul><li>Select &quot;Entire message&quot; for a full search</li></ul>
	</li>
	<li>Select time period to stay within</li>
	<li>Select whether to look for the entire phrase or random occurences of individual words</li>
	<li>Select which folder to look in</li>
	<li>Select whether to also look in sub-folders</li>
	<li>Start your search by clicking <input type="button" class="button" value="OK"/></li>
</ol>

<p>
<span class="note">Tip:</span>
To do a quick search, enter text in the &quot;Start search&quot; field in the Hotlist and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
</p>

<h2 id="m2-finetune">Fine-tuning M2</h2>

<h3 id="m2-multiple">Using multiple accounts</h3>

<p>
If you have multiple e-mail accounts, for example <span class="mailaddress">home@example.net</span>, <span class="mailaddress">hobby@example.org</span>, and <span class="mailaddress">work@example.com</span>, you can add them all by selecting <span class="mainmenu">New account</span> on the <span class="mainmenu"><a href="main.html#mailmenu">Mail</a></span> menu.
</p>

<p>
When you click the Check button, new messages from all your accounts will be downloaded to your computer.

<h2 id="m2-imap">IMAP</h2>

<h3>About IMAP</h3>

<p>
IMAP organizes your e-mail messages on the mail server.
Regardless of where you are when you look at your e-mail, you will see the same messages organized the same way, even if you use different computers.
This is much more work than with POP accounts.
</p>

<p>
<span class="note">Warning:</span>
Setting up an e-mail account to use both POP and IMAP simultaneously is likely to cause problems.
Therefore, use either POP or IMAP for each account.
</p>

<h3>Setting up an IMAP account</h3>

<p>
To set up an IMAP account, follow <a href="#m2-new">the procedure for POP</a> and select IMAP instead of POP when asked.
</p>

<p>
<span class="note">Note:</span>
Make sure the e-mail service you want to use supports IMAP.
</p>

<h3>Using IMAP</h3>

<p>
When your IMAP folder has been set up, and all messages are downloaded to your computer, your IMAP folder tree appears in the Hotlist under &quot;Mail for...&quot;.
</p>

<p>
The INBOX folder is the default folder for incoming messages and cannot be deleted.
</p>

<p>
Double-click your INBOX to read your e-mail.
Reading and writing messages over IMAP is similar to working with POP.
</p>

<h3>Maintaining IMAP folders</h3>

<p>
Select <span class="mainmenu">IMAP folders</span> on the <span class="mainmenu"><a href="main.html#mailmenu">Mail</a></span> menu to customize your IMAP folder tree.
</p>

<p>
Click the checkboxes to select which IMAP folders you want to access from your computer.
</p>

<p>
Click <input type="button" class="button" value="New"/> to create a new IMAP folder.
</p>

<p>
Click <input type="button" class="button" value="Delete"/> to delete an IMAP folder on the mail server. (Note that all messages in that folder will be lost.)
</p>

<h3>Moving messages between folders</h3>

<p>
To move a message from one IMAP folder to another, drag the message from the message view and drop it to the new folder.
</p>

<h3>Options</h3>

<p>
Account options are the same as for POP, with these additions:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>You can set the path to your IMAP root folder
		<ul><li>This is only needed if indicated by your service provider</li></ul>
	</li>
	<li>You can choose a folder on the IMAP server in which to store messages sent from your IMAP account</li>
</ul>

<p>
<span class="note">Note:</span>
To take full advantage of M2's IMAP capabilities, you should be connected to the Internet.
</p>

<h2 id="news">News</h2>

<p>
While an e-mail is usually sent to a single person or a few people, posting a news article can be compared to putting notices on a public bulletin board.
</p>

<h3>Setting up a news account</h3>

<p>
To set up your news account, do the following:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Select <span class="mainmenu">New account</span> on the <span class="mainmenu"><a href="main.html#mailmenu">Mail</a></span> menu</li>
	<li>Select &quot;News&quot; when the account wizard starts</li>
	<li>Enter your name, e-mail address, and organization (optional)</li>
	<li>Enter the news-server information given to you by your service provider</li>
	<li>Click <input type="button" class="button" value="Finish"/> to create your new account</li>
</ol>

<p>
<span class="note">Tip:</span>
To participate in newsgroups about the Opera Web browser, enter <span class="url">news.opera.com</span> as news server.
</p>

<h3>Subscribing to newsgroups</h3>

<p>
To subscribe to newsgroups on your news server, do the following:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Select <span class="mainmenu">Newsgroups</span> on the <span class="mainmenu"><a href="main.html#mailmenu">Mail</a></span> menu</li>
	<li>Subscribe to groups by clicking the respective checkboxes in the list</li>
	<li>Click <input type="button" class="button" value="OK"/> to subscribe</li>
</ol>

<p>
<span class="note">Tip:</span>
Enter text in the &quot;Quick find&quot; field to find particular newsgroups without scrolling through the whole list.
</p>

<h3>Reading news</h3>

<p>
To read a newsgroup, double-click the group you want to read in your &quot;News at&quot; access point.
</p>

<p>
Reading and writing news articles is practically the same as working with e-mail messages. Note, however, the following:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Click &quot;Reply&quot; to post a follow-up article, as an answer to the article you are currently reading</li>
	<li>Click &quot;Reply all&quot; to both post a follow-up and reply to the author by e-mail</li>
	<li>Enter a comma-separated list of groups if you want to post your article in multiple groups (called &quot;cross-posting&quot;)</li>
	<li>Enter e-mail addresses in the Cc field to send people copies of the article by e-mail</li>
	<li>Deleting a news article only deletes your local copy -- a news article is never deleted from the server</li>
</ul>
