<h1 id="security">Security</h1>

<p>
You can manage your security certificates and configure security protocols.
Opera can also warn you about potentially insecure situations.
</p>

<p>
<span class="note">Tip:</span>
Read Opera's tutorial for an excellent introduction to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.opera.com/support/tutorials/security/"> protecting your personal information and security</a> on the Internet.
</p>

<h2 id="security-password">Security password</h2>

<p>
A security password prevents other people from using your certificates, as long as you select a good password and keep it secret.
Click <input type="button" class="button" value="Set password"/> to enable a security password.
</p>

<p>
If other people have access to your computer, it may be a good idea to tell Opera to ask for a password every time needed, that is every time you use certificates.
</p>

<p>
You can also use the security password to protect your e-mail, news, and <a href="wand.html">Wand</a> passwords with strong encryption.
</p>

<p>
<span class="note">Technical note:</span>
If you set the security password to protect Wand data and e-mail passwords, Opera will use 168-bit triple DES (data encryption standard) encryption. Keys are derived from the security password.
</p>

<h2 id="security-protocols">Security protocols</h2>

<p>
Security protocols are used to communicate securely with sites where sensitive data, such as credit card information, is involved.
</p>

<h3>Enabling and disabling protocols</h3>

<p>
To enable a security protocol, check the respective checkbox.
Supported protocols include:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 2.0</li>
	<li>Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 3.0</li>
	<li>Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0 - most secure</li>
</ol>

<p>
Disable (uncheck) SSL 2 and SSL 3 if you wish to only use the most secure protocol (TLS) to establish secure connections.
If you experience problems on secure sites, try turning SSL back on.
</p>

<h3>Configure protocols</h3>

<p>
You can click for example <input type="button" class="button" value="Configure SSL 2"/> and tell Opera not to accept certain ciphers.
To prevent connections to less secure Web services, disable ciphers below 128 bits.
</p>

<p>
<span class="note">Tip:</span>
When you visit secure sites, the padlock icon on the Address bar locks.
Move your mouse pointer over the security icon for detailed information about the current level of security.
</p>

<h2 id="security-certificates">Certificates</h2>

<p>
Generally, certificates are used to verify identities.
</p>

<h3>Authorities</h3>

<p>
Certificate authorities are used to identify secure Web sites.
Most certificate authorities you need are installed with Opera.
</p>

<p>
<span class="note">Example:</span>
The secure version of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uio.no/">University of Oslo</a> Web site is authorized by the Thawte organization.
</p>

<table class="nice">
<tr>
	<th>Option</th>
	<th>Explanation</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><input type="button" class="button" value="Import"/></td>
	<td>Import certificates you have exported from other browsers or downloaded</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><input type="button" class="button" value="Export"/></td>
	<td>Export certificates you wish to use in other browsers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><input type="button" class="button" value="Delete"/></td>
	<td>Delete certificates you no longer trust or wish to use</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>
		<input type="checkbox" checked="checked"/>
		Allow connections to sites certified by this authority
	</td>
	<td>Disable (uncheck) to block connections to all sites certified by authority</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>
		<input type="checkbox"/>
		Warn before sending data to sites certified by this authority
	</td>
	<td>Enable (check) if you want Opera to warn you before using authority</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
<span class="note">Note:</span>
If you delete a certificate authority, you must reinstall Opera or download the certificate from the original provider to restore it.
</p>

<p>
Read about <a href="dialogs.html#certificate">accepting certificates</a> for more information.
</p>

<h3>Personal</h3>

<p>
Personal certificates are used to identify you as the genuine user of a Web service.
These certificates are normally installed the first time you sign up for the service.
</p>

<p>
The options to import, export, and delete are basically the same as for certificate authorities (see above).
</p>

<p>
<span class="note">Note:</span>
If you delete a personal certificate, you must create a new one to use the corresponding Web service.
</p>

<h2 id="security-warnings">Security warnings</h2>

<p>
By default, Opera will warn you before you submit
</p>

<ul>
	<li>a form insecurely</li>
	<li>a Web page for validation</li>
</ul>

<p>
Submitting forms to, for example, search engines and open discussion forums is harmless.
</p>

<p>
<span class="note">Tip:</span>
Enable the security warnings if you are concerned about unintentionally sending sensitive data over the Internet.
